# Rock-Papper-Scissors
This is my version of the game Rock-Papper-Scissors that I made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where the player is playing against a robot that spits out random sign.
The robot sign is showed with a picture of rock, papper and scissors, but it has a bug on it where the picture of robots choice disappear if it is the same as the last
one.
For now!!
